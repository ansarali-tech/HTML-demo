# HTML
I write demo code of html in some chapters above. But before to tell about code I write in chapters, lets briefly describe HTML.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to create content and structure for web pages and other types of electronic documents that can be displayed on the web. HTML provides a way to structure and organize content on a web page using a variety of elements, tags, and attributes.

## Elements
HTML elements are used to define the structure and content of a web page. An HTML element consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. For example, the `<p>` element is used to define a paragraph of text, and is typically written as `<p>...</p>`.

## Tags
HTML tags are used to mark up content on a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, such as `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`. Tags can also have attributes that provide additional information about the element.

## Attributes
HTML attributes are used to provide additional information about an element. Attributes are added to the opening tag of an element and consist of a name and a value. For example, the `href` attribute is used to specify the URL of a link.

## Semantic Markup
HTML provides a variety of semantic elements that are used to define the meaning of content on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables. This allows search engines and other software to better understand the structure and content of a web page.

<!DOCTYPE html> declaration indicates that the document is an HTML5 document. The <html> element is used to define the root of the document, and contains the <head> and <body> elements. The <head> element contains metadata about the document, such as the page title. The <body> element contains the visible content of the web page, including a heading, some text, and an unordered list.
